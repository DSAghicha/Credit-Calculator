### Programme Details

Sometimes we need some extra money so, we decide to take a loan.

This loan can be repaid either **monthly annuity** or **differentiated payments**.

This programme can be used in two formats:

1. Command Line Interface
   
   **Steps**

   - Download **cli.zip** from [Releases](https://github.com/DSAghicha/Credit-Calculator/releases/latest) and unzip it on your PC.
    
     This zip file will have one directory which will have two files ```main.py``` & ```cli.py```.
   - Open Terminal in this directory and run ```python cli.py```.
   
     Alternatively, you can open it in your favourite code editor and run it from there as well.
        
2. Command Line Arguments
   
   **Steps**
   
   - Download **cl_args.zip** from [Releases](https://github.com/DSAghicha/Credit-Calculator/releases/latest) and unzip it on your PC.
